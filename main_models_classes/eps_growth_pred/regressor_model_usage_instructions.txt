To use the saved model:
1. Load the model using pickle:
   with open('decision_tree_regressor_model.pkl', 'rb') as model_file:
       model = pickle.load(model_file)

2. Prepare your data (make sure it has the same features as the training data):
   X_new = ...  # Your new data

3. Predict using the loaded model:
   predictions = model.predict(X_new)
